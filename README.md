# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project Name: Geovitz

### Overview
This project is designed as a proof of concept to demonstrate the core functionalities of our Geovitz for data visualization of non experts, "data-driven analysis and visualization tool for predicting and understanding user behavior". This prototype serves as a preliminary implementation, showcasing the progress made and laying the foundation for future development.

---

## Key Features Implemented

- **Core Interface Design**
  - Developed the main user interface, allowing users to navigate smoothly between pages and understand the project’s primary functions.
  - Implemented basic navigation flow and core visual elements, which will help users engage with the final product’s full capabilities.

- **Initial Data Visualization Tools**
  - Created placeholder charts and graphs to represent potential data visualizations that will later display predictions and analysis results.
  - These elements demonstrate the tool's intended functionality by simulating possible data outputs, helping users understand how insights will be presented.

- **User Interaction Components**
  - Added basic interactive features to let users engage with the prototype and experience its preliminary functionality.
  - input fields have been set up, allowing initial testing of how users will interact with the platform.

---

## Features Yet to be Developed

- **Machine Learning Models for Data Analysis and Predictions**
  - We are planning to integrate advanced machine learning models to analyze past data and generate predictive insights.
  - These models will process past data(Like past data distribution or trends) and provide forecasts, offering users valuable information for making data-driven decisions.

- **Heat Maps for Data Distribution**
  - Heat maps will be incorporated to provide a visual representation of data distribution across different variables.
  - This feature will enhance data interpretation by allowing users to easily identify patterns and outliers in the data.

- **Extended Data Visualization and Enhanced User Interaction**
  - Additional charts, graphs, and visualization tools will be added to provide a richer user experience.
  - More advanced interaction capabilities will also be incorporated, making the interface intuitive and adaptable for various user needs.

## Usage Guide

1. **Getting Started**
   - To begin using the prototype, clone the repository and install necessary dependencies.
   - Run the command `npm start` to launch the application on your local server (instructions may vary based on your setup).

2. **Navigating the Prototype**
   - The main interface allows to uload the dataset, get a data preview of the dataset and select between charts(bar and pie) using radio buttons.


## Next Steps

We plan to:
1. Develop and integrate machine learning algorithms to process historical data and make predictions.
2. Create heat maps to visually convey data distribution and usage patterns.
3. Expand data visualization options and improve user interaction based on initial feedback.
